## Complexity Analysis for Bubble Sorting
Time Complexity: -Worst Case: O(n²) -This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order. The algorithm has to make the maximum number of comparisons and swaps. -Average Case: O(n²) -On average, the algorithm will have to go through the array multiple times, leading to quadratic time complexity. -Best Case: O(n) -This occurs when the array is already sorted. A small optimization can be added to check if any swaps were made in an iteration, allowing the algorithm to terminate early.
Space Complexity: -O(1) -Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it does not require additional storage proportional to the input size.
## Summary For Bubble Sorting
-Efficiency: Bubble Sort is generally inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n²) time complexity in both average and worst cases. It performs well on small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.
-Stability: Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that the relative order of equal elements is preserved.
-In-Place: The algorithm operates in-place, requiring only a constant amount of additional storage space (O(1)).
-Use Cases: While Bubble Sort is not commonly used in practice due to its inefficiency, it is often taught as an introductory sorting algorithm because of its simplicity and ease of understanding.
## Complexity Analysis For Quick Sorting
Time Complexity: -Worst Case: O(n²) -This occurs when the pivot chosen is the smallest or largest element repeatedly, leading to unbalanced partitions. This is common in already sorted or reverse-sorted arrays. -Average Case: O(n log n) -On average, Quick Sort partitions the array into two equal halves, leading to logarithmic depth in recursion. -Best Case: O(n log n) -The best-case scenario also occurs when the pivot divides the array into two equal halves consistently.
Space Complexity: -O(log n) -This is due to the recursive stack space used by the algorithm. In the worst case, the space complexity can degrade to O(n) for highly unbalanced partitions.
## Summary For Quick Sorting
-Efficiency: Quick Sort is generally efficient with an average time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for large datasets compared to simpler algorithms like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort.
-Stability: Quick Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm; the relative order of equal elements may not be preserved.
-In-Place: The algorithm is in-place, using minimal additional storage (O(log n) for the recursion stack).
-Use Cases: Quick Sort is widely used in practice, especially in systems where performance is critical. Its efficiency, combined with its in-place sorting capability, makes it a popular choice for both general-purpose and specialized sorting tasks.
